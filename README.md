This project was completed by Anna Blendermann, Ashley Dear, Ronnie Davis, and Hunter Klamut.

Grab-A-Bite was created as a new sort of social media application, similar to Tinder, that would help students to make friends through food. A user can set up their profile according to types of foods they like, times they are available, and more. Then, they can make matches which are limited to other users with matching food interests and time availabilities. These matches can be seen in the "My Matches" page with their contact information, such as their phone number and email address.# Grab-a-Bite
